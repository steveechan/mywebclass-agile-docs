# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
MyWebClass is a complex website that requires a collaborative team of developers working together in parallel to create various pieces of content that align with the objectives of the site. To start off the project, we will be utilizing a "pull" approach to development, which means we will concentrate our efforts on creating a basic web template that adheres to any relevant legal requirements, can be found on search engines, allows for legal usage of Google Analytics to monitor user behavior, and passes rigorous validation tests such as Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner, and w3c validation.

To achieve our objective, we will need to focus on three main areas of the project. Firstly, we will create Basic Project Documentation and Project Management procedures to ensure that all team members are in alignment with each other and working towards the same goal. Secondly, we will establish a DevOps procedure that supports the development of the project, ensuring that we can effectively manage the development and deployment of our website.

Lastly, we will develop the MyWebClass.org base website template, ensuring that it satisfies all technical and legal requirements necessary for us to use Google Analytics while being appropriately listed on search engines. This will entail ensuring that the website template meets all relevant technical and legal requirements and is optimized for search engines. To achieve this goal, we will implement basic on-page SEO practices and follow industry best practices.

In addition to planning the initial 0.1.0 release of the website template, we will also need to strategize for the ongoing development and improvement of the website. This will entail using agile methodologies such as Scrum to manage our development process, regularly reviewing our progress, and adapting our plans as necessary.

Our ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly, functional, and optimized website that meets the needs of our users and provides value to them. Throughout the development process, we will prioritize collaboration and communication, ensuring that all team members are aligned and working towards the same goal. By doing so, we will create a website that meets our users' needs, provides value to them, and positively reflects the brand of MyWebClass.
