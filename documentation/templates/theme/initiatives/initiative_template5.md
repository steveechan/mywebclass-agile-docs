Title of the Initiative: Set up the CI/CD DevOps processes

Description: This initiative aims to establish a streamlined and efficient development process by implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices through a DevOps approach.

Goals:

Automate the software development process to improve efficiency and reduce errors.

Implement a collaborative and integrated development process to foster teamwork and communication among team members.

Ensure the timely delivery of high-quality software releases through a standardized deployment process.

Scope:

The scope of this initiative includes the implementation of CI/CD practices through the DevOps approach. This includes the integration of tools and technologies for automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery.

Outcomes:

Improved software quality through automated testing and continuous feedback.

Faster release cycles and shorter time to market.

Increased collaboration and communication between development and operations teams.

Reduced errors and improved efficiency through automation.

Deliverables:

CI/CD pipeline architecture and design documentation.

Automated testing framework and toolset.

Integration of collaboration tools such as Jira and Slack.

Deployment automation framework and toolset.

Milestones:

Completion of CI/CD pipeline architecture and design documentation - 2 weeks.

Integration of automated testing framework - 4 weeks.

Integration of collaboration tools - 6 weeks.

Deployment automation framework implementation - 8 weeks.

Constraints:

Limited budget for toolset acquisition and maintenance.

Technical limitations in integrating existing legacy systems.

Assumptions:
