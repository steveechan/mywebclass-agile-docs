Task Title: Integrate Unit Tests into CI/CD Pipeline

User Story: (https://github.com/steveechan/mywebclass-agile-docs/blob/main/documentation/templates/theme/initiatives/epics/stories/story_template5.md)

Description: The task involves integrating unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline. The developer needs to create unit tests for their code and configure the pipeline to automatically run these tests after each code change is pushed to the repository. The test results should be reported to the development team, and the pipeline should stop and alert the team if any tests fail. The developer also needs to track and report the test coverage to the development team.

Effort Estimate: 10 story points

Assigned To: Developer

Priority: Medium

Status: Not started

Notes: Developer will need to ensure that the testing framework and tools used for the unit tests are compatible with the CI/CD pipeline. He will also need to coordinate with the DevOps engineer to ensure that the pipeline is configured correctly for running the tests. Once the unit tests are integrated into the pipeline, John will need to monitor the test results and coverage and make any necessary updates to the tests or pipeline configuration.
