As a developer, I want to integrate automated testing into the CI/CD pipeline, so that I can ensure that new code changes do not introduce bugs or regressions.

Acceptance Criteria:

Automated testing is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

Tests are run automatically after each code change is pushed to the repository.

The test results are reported to the development team.

The pipeline stops and alerts the development team if any tests fail.

The test coverage is tracked and reported to the development team.

Note: The implementation of this user story will contribute to the goal of improving software delivery speed and quality, as well as reducing manual processes and errors.
